# Heart Disease prediction using Random Forest and Logistic regression

## Problem statement
Heart diseases are fatal and their early detection can save numerous lives. The problem  is to predict if a patient has heart disease using general data points such as age, chest pain type, sex, Blood Pressure, and other similar data points.

## Possible solution
One of the possible solution can be a screening test provided by government or hospitals for free on their website. This can greatly benifit disease discovery at an early stage. These screening tests can use machine learning models to predict results.

Logistic regression accuracy - 87.68%
Random forest accuracy       - 87.31%
